The person found that these short 1-3 second clips were able to help the person remember what they had done that day and also encouraged the person to do new activities, breaking out of the daily pattern of autopilot. I thought this was a great idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, when I have travelled, I found myself immersed in many activites and experiencing a lot. At the end of the trip, I would forget a lot of the small details and only remmeber the really important parts. Therefore, I decided to take this concept and apply it to the holidays that I go on to make travel videos! I will be posting a lot of those travel memories on this page, hopefully you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Awhile ago I watched a video of a Tedx talk about a person that would record 1-3 seconds of video footage everyday, collating the footage at the end of it.
