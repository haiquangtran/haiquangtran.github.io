I recently bought a new GoPro Hero 6 as well as a Gimbal (Evo GP-Pro Stabilizier).
A friend of mine had also bought some new camera equipment, so we decided to go out on a Sunday afternoon to Makara Walkway for some practice shots. 

The footage turned out to be great! 
Take a look below and let me know what you think!
