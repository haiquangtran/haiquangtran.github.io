# Bored in Australia's lockdown? Bubble Tea to rescue!

Having been stranded at home in Melbourne, Australia for around 7 months now due to COVID lockdown, I thought it'd be a good idea to share something that I've come across!

**DIY bubble tea kits within Australia!**
Since I am a huge bubble tea fan, one of my friends has sent me one of the **[Boba Luxe kits](https://bobaluxe.com.au/collections/boba-luxe-kits)** as a gift and it is a game changer!
I have been spending my time making delicious bubble tea from the comfort of my home during Melbourne's lockdown.
I found this was a great fun activity that I could do via video with friends and family all across the world.

It's really simple and easy to make. If you have the [ingredients](https://bobaluxe.com.au/collections/all) you can easily follow the [recipes](https://bobaluxe.com.au/pages/recipes).
It takes less than 10 minutes and I can adjust the flavours of my bubble tea to my preferences. 
I actually prefer this over the bubble tea shops. I would highly recommend you give it a try if you like bubble tea! 

On my Boba Luxe Kit, I found a discount code for 10% off. 
Use the code **BOBALOVER** on the [Boba Luxe website](https://www.bobaluxe.com.au) and let me know what you think!
