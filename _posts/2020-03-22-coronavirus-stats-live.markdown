# Coronavirus (COVID-19) tracker

See the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Stats Live tracker here: https://ncovstats.live.

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic, that has turned our world upside down.
It is important to stay well informed and understand how we can prevent the spread of COVID-19.

At the time of writing this, I am currently in self isolation and keeping a positive mindset.
With free time on my hands, I wanted to help by any means necessary.
I created a website to help track the spread of COVID-19 and allow others to see how the virus affects the world.
I am hopeful this will show others the severity of the virus and how quickly it spreads. 
It also reinforces the idea that we need to "flatten the curve" and take measures to stop the spread of coronavirus.

The site is now live, with more upcoming features coming soon.
You can find the website here: https://ncovstats.live

If there are any features you would like to see, please leave a comment below. I am always happy to help.

Look after yourselves, make sure to wash your hands frequently, stay at home (practise social distancing if you must leave home), and avoid touching your face.
Together we will get through this tough time.

All the best.
