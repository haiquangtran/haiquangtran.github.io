# My First Marathon

## What made me want to run a marathon?

Early 2019, I random idea popped into my head. "A marathon would be a good challenge" I thought to myself. 
I pitched the idea to a friend and 3 hours later we were signed up to the Canberra Times marathon (that was scheduled to happen 1-2 months from then)!
Excited and not knowing the long journey it would take us on. Keep in mind, we both had no to little training and no time before the marathon!

## Marathon post-poned due to COVID

Unfortunately, 2019 was the year that the COVID-19 outbreak happened. Therefore, the marathon kept getting cancelled. My friend and I had booked flights to Canberra but could no longer go due to COVID.
They postponed the marathon numerous times until 2021.

## Thoughts before Race Day

After a year of the Canberra Times marathon being cancelled due to COVID (2019), we were finally able to attend.
Excited and with our flights all booked, we came to the realisation that we both hardly trained. I only ran once in the last 2-3 months before the marathon (16km). 
Before that, I'd only ran 5 times (the longest being 21km). My friend only had ran maximum of 9km before the marathon! 

Nervous and anxious, I was starting to doubt if I could complete it. However, the sense of just showing up to the marathon was an accomplishment in itself.

## Marathon Day

Woke up at 3 am on the day and had some breakfast to carbload for the race. 
Couldn't get back to sleep so stayed up and left around 5.30 am to the race.

The race started at 6.25 am in the morning and it was very cold!
Early in the morning, I just remember wearing a singlet and shorts in the freezing cold (with cold winds), and trying to warm up my hands by blowing on them as I ran!

I found myself running fast in the beginning with everyone else but had to remind myself to slow down. It's not a race, it's a "marathon" ;).
It made me think of a metaphor for life. The metaphor being that each of us are on our own journey and we go at our own pace, enjoying the journey and process.
I took my time and paced myself, enjoying the view as I ran. There were uphill parts which I was not prepared for but I embraced the moment!

I ran nonstop for 31kms, when I started running out of energy and my legs were very sore. My stomach felt like it was shrinking and I was starving.

Luckily, a kind person I met who was running the Ultra gave me a quarter of his bar, and one of his gels. It was the pickup I needed.
I ran the next 7km only stopping a few times to stretch then carry on running. 
It was definitely a mental battle and was one of the most difficult things I have done, especially the last 2km, where there was a uphill section.

Last 2km felt like the longest kms in my life. Every step hurt. Once I stopped for a stretch or rest, it was so much harder to start running again.
I'm glad I pushed through it. 

## The Aftermath
Legs sore, leg joints sore, elbow joints sore, bascially everything is sore. Chaffing on my armpits.
Limping for a week. 
Yup, I think that's it for me.

## Lessons for the next marathon?
- Train consistently so joints and body can adapt to the stress of running. 
- Come prepared for the temperature, bring warmer clothes (depending on where race is). A singlet and shorts on a 6 am run on a cold morning in Canberra was not comfortable.
- Bring some snacks (bars) and Gels! (important). Gels were life savers in my first Marathon run. I don't know if I could do without it.
- Stay hydrated.
- Monitor pace, and save energy for the last 10km of the race. Around the 30km mark is where the real race begins (between mind and body).
